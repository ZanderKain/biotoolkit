This is my changelog to track the progression of my bioinformatic tool kit I am developing.
I will go ahead and update this log with what has been added to the tool kit once new features are made in descanding order (4 to 3, 3 to 2, etc...).

MAIN Branch made on: 23MAY2024
    1. Python files with functionality of doing basic analysis over a string of DNA were created.
    2. "bio_main.py", "bio_seq.py", and "bio_structs.py" are new python files added converting the functions in "main.py", "DNATOOLKit.py" into classes to better improve fluency with larger datasets.
